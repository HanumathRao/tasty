/** The signature of a denotation.
 *  Overloaded denotations with the same name are distinguished by
 *  their signatures. A signature of a method (of type PolyType,MethodType, or ExprType) is
 *  composed of a list of signature names, one for each parameter type, plus a signature for
 *  the result type. Methods are uncurried before taking their signatures.
 *  The signature name of a type is the fully qualified name of the type symbol of the type's erasure.
 *
 *  For instance a definition
 *
 *      def f(x: Int)(y: List[String]): String
 *
 *  would have signature
 *
 *      Signature(
 *        List("scala.Int".toTypeName, "scala.collection.immutable.List".toTypeName),
 *        "scala.String".toTypeName)
 *
 *  The signatures of non-method types are always `NotAMethod`.
