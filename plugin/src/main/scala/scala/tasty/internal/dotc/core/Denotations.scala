/** Denotations represent the meaning of symbols and named types.
 *  The following diagram shows how the principal types of denotations
 *  and their denoting entities relate to each other. Lines ending in
 *  a down-arrow `v` are member methods. The two methods shown in the diagram are
 *  "symbol" and "deref". Both methods are parameterized by the current context,
 *  and are effectively indexed by current period.
 *
 *  Lines ending in a horizontal line mean subtying (right is a subtype of left).

 *  Here's a short summary of the classes in this diagram.
 *
 *  NamedType                A type consisting of a prefix type and a name, with fields
 *                              prefix: Type
 *                              name: Name
 *                           It has two subtypes: TermRef and TypeRef
 *  TermRefWithSignature     A TermRef that has in addition a signature to select an overloaded variant, with new field
 *                              sig: Signature
 *  Symbol                   A label for a definition or declaration in one compiler run
 *  ClassSymbol              A symbol representing a class
 *  Denotation               The meaning of a named type or symbol during a period
 *  MultiDenotation          A denotation representing several overloaded members
 *  SingleDenotation         A denotation representing a non-overloaded member or definition, with main fields
 *                              symbol: Symbol
 *                              info: Type
 *  UniqueRefDenotation      A denotation referring to a single definition with some member type
 *  JointRefDenotation       A denotation referring to a member that could resolve to several definitions
 *  SymDenotation            A denotation representing a single definition with its original type, with main fields
 *                              name: Name
 *                              owner: Symbol
 *                              flags: Flags
 *                              privateWithin: Symbol
 *                              annotations: List[Annotation]
 *  ClassDenotation          A denotation representing a single class definition.

object Denotations {

  /** A denotation is the result of resolving
   *  a name (either simple identifier or select) during a given period.
   *
   *  Denotations can be combined with `&` and `|`.
   *  & is conjunction, | is disjunction.
   *
   *  `&` will create an overloaded denotation from two
   *  non-overloaded denotations if their signatures differ.
   *  Analogously `|` of two denotations with different signatures will give
   *  an empty denotation `NoDenotation`.
   *
   *  A denotation might refer to `NoSymbol`. This is the case if the denotation
   *  was produced from a disjunction of two denotations with different symbols
   *  and there was no common symbol in a superclass that could substitute for
   *  both symbols. Here is an example:
   *
   *  Say, we have:
   *
   *    class A { def f: A }
   *    class B { def f: B }
   *    val x: A | B = if (test) new A else new B
   *    val y = x.f
   *
   *  Then the denotation of `y` is `SingleDenotation(NoSymbol, A | B)`.
   *
   *  @param symbol  The referencing symbol, or NoSymbol is none exists
